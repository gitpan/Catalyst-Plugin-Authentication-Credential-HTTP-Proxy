DESCRIPTION
    This moduule lets you use HTTP Proxy authentication with
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication.

    Currently this module only supports the Basic scheme, but upon request
    Digest will also be added. Patches welcome!

CONFIG
    This module reads config from $c->config->{authentication}{http_proxy}.
    The following settings are supported:

    url Required. A url protected with basic authentication to authenticate
        against.

    store
        To specify what store to use. will use the default store if not set.

METHODS
    authorization_required
        Tries to "authenticate_http_proxy", and if that fails calls
        "authorization_required_response" and detaches the current action
        call stack.

    authenticate_http_proxy
        Looks inside "$c->request->headers" and processes the basic (badly
        named) authorization header. Then authenticates this against the
        provided url.

    authorization_required_response
        Sets "$c->response" to the correct status code, and adds the correct
        header to demand authentication data from the user agent.
